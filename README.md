# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice Repository

Welcome to my Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice repository! Here, I've compiled my solutions to various DSA problems using C++. This repository is aimed at consolidating my understanding of fundamental algorithms and data structures, following the teaching styles of educators like Babar, Striver, and other popular resources.

## Concepts Covered

In this repository, you'll find implementations and explanations for a wide range of DSA concepts, including but not limited to:

- **Arrays and Strings**: Manipulation, searching, and sorting.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, circular linked lists, etc.
- **Stacks and Queues**: Basic operations, implementations using arrays and linked lists.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, segment trees, Fenwick trees (Binary Indexed Tree), etc.
- **Graphs**: Representation, traversal (DFS, BFS), shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford), minimum spanning tree (Prim's, Kruskal's), etc.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort, counting sort, radix sort, etc.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Linear search, binary search, ternary search, interpolation search, etc.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Memoization, tabulation, classic problems (e.g., knapsack, longest common subsequence), optimization techniques.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: Activity selection problem, Huffman coding, Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths in weighted graphs, etc.
- **Hashing**: Hash tables, collision handling techniques (chaining, open addressing), hashing applications.

## Learning Resources

To enhance my understanding of DSA and follow best practices, I draw inspiration from renowned educators like Babar and Striver, as well as utilize the following resources:

- **Babar's YouTube Channel**: [Babar's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZCFT11CWBi3MHNlGf019nw) for comprehensive tutorials on DSA topics with clear explanations and problem-solving techniques.

- **Striver's YouTube Channel**: [Striver's YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJskGeByzRRSvmOyZOz61ig) offering detailed lectures on competitive programming and DSA, including in-depth explanations of algorithms and data structures.

- **GeeksforGeeks**: Reference articles and tutorials on [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/) for additional explanations and examples of DSA concepts.

- **LeetCode**: Utilizing platforms like [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) for practicing DSA problems, following curated lists of problems recommended by educators like Babar and Striver.

- **Competitive Programming Websites**: Participating in contests and solving problems on competitive programming platforms like Codeforces, HackerRank, and AtCoder to reinforce DSA skills.
